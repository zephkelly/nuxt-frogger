# üê∏ Frogger

### The zero-setup logger for Nuxt

Log and trace from anywhere in your Nuxt applications. Server to client, client to server, to external services and back again. Install Frogger - add it as a module, and it just works. Automatically batches and sends logs to the server, storing them in formatted json files. No matter where you make a log, you'll find it in the same place.

## Installation

### Automatic Installation

To install and register the latest version of Frogger, navigate to your Nuxt project and run the following command:

**pnpm:**
```sh
pnpm dlx nuxi@latest module add nuxt-frogger
```

**npm:**
```sh
npx nuxi@latest module add nuxt-frogger
```

**yarn:**
```sh
yarn dlx nuxi@latest module add nuxt-frogger
```

**bun:**
```sh
bunx nuxi@latest module add nuxt-frogger
```

And that's it! A default configuration of Frogger is now installed in your Nuxt project. Take a look at the getting started guide to learn how to make your first log.

### Manual Installation
