# 🐸 Frogger
### The zero-setup logger for Nuxt
Log and trace from anywhere in your Nuxt applications. Server to client, client to server, SSR to CSR and back again. Install Frogger and add it as a module, and it just works. Automatically batches and sends logs to the server, storing them in formatted json files. No matter where you make a log, you'll find it in the same place.
